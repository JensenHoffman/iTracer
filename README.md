# iTracer
The new curve tracer we developed (iTracer) features:
Balanced Cost-Effectiveness, Performance. 
User-oriented functions
Newly-Developed Math Algorithm that accelerate transistor matching and management.
Friendly GUI that minimizes learning cost
Provide a new tracer option of hobbyist-grade 
 Software that ensures flexibility and freedom

We will not talk about highly professional, industrial curve tracers as they are very expensive that hobbyist cannot afford. 
Besides, most commercial curve tracers do not provide good ability to meet DIYers’ requirement of matching and managing semiconductors efficiently and accurately. 

We mainly discuss and develop curve tracers from the (audio) DIYers’ point of view, which emphasize transistor matching, selecting, grouping and cost-effectiveness.
